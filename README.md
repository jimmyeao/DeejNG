DeejNG is a modern, extensible audio mixer and controller for Windows, built with WPF (.NET 9), NAudio, and SkiaSharp. It allows real-time control over system and app volumes using physical sliders (e.g. Arduino), complete with VU meters, mute toggles, and persistent target mappings. This is meant as a companion app to the hardware, the code for which can be found here https://github.com/omriharel/deej

## 🧩 How It Works

- Channels (sliders) are represented by `ChannelControl` elements.
- Each slider is mapped to one or more **targets**:
  - System audio
  - Specific applications (by executable name)
  - Current application (by focused window)
  - Input devices (microphones)
  - Unmapped sessions (everything else)
- Volume data is received via serial (USB COM port).
- VU meters are driven by a 25ms dispatcher timer, showing real-time audio levels.
- Targets are assigned via a double-click on a channel, launching a session picker.

## 🖱️ Usage Instructions

### 🎚️ Setting Up Sliders

1. Connect your physical slider hardware (e.g. Arduino).
2. Launch DeejNG.
3. Select the correct COM port from the dropdown and click **Connect**.
4. Sliders will auto-generate based on incoming serial data (e.g. `0.5|0.3|...`).

### 🎯 Assigning Targets

- **Double-click a slider** to open the session picker.
- Select from running applications, "System", "Unmapped Applications", or microphones.
- You can select multiple targets per slider. One slider can control multiple apps or a mic.

### 🔇 Mute / Unmute

- Click the **Mute** button on each channel to toggle audio mute.
- The button will turn red when muted.

### 📊 Show/Hide Meters

- Use the "Show Sliders" checkbox to toggle VU meters.
- Meters update live with peak-hold animation.

### ⚙️ Settings

Settings are saved automatically and include:
- Assigned targets per slider
- Input mode per channel
- Theme preference (light/dark)
- Slider inversion
- Smoothing toggle
- Start on boot
- Start minimized
