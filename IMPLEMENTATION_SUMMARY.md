# Multi-Monitor Overlay Position Fix - Implementation Summary

## Problem Statement

The overlay position was being saved, but not correctly restored in multi-monitor setups because:
1. Only X and Y coordinates were saved
2. No information about which screen the overlay was on
3. No handling for display configuration changes (docking/undocking)

## Solution Overview

Implemented a comprehensive multi-monitor position management system that:
- Saves screen information along with coordinates
- Validates and corrects position when displays change
- Handles proportional repositioning when screen bounds change
- Gracefully moves overlay to primary screen when saved screen is missing

## Files Created

### 1. `Core/Helpers/ScreenPositionManager.cs` (NEW)
**Purpose**: Centralized screen position management and validation

**Key Features**:
- `GetScreenInfo(x, y)` - Identifies which screen a position is on
- `ValidateAndCorrectPosition()` - Validates saved position against current display config
- Handles three scenarios:
  - Screen exists with same bounds → No correction
  - Screen exists with different bounds → Proportional adjustment
  - Screen missing → Move to primary screen proportionally
- `GetScreenDiagnostics()` - Debug information about current screens

**Key Methods**:
```csharp
public static ScreenInfo GetScreenInfo(double x, double y)
public static bool ValidateAndCorrectPosition(AppSettings settings, out double correctedX, out double correctedY)
public static string GetScreenDiagnostics()
```

### 2. `MULTI_MONITOR_OVERLAY.md` (NEW)
**Purpose**: Complete documentation of the multi-monitor solution

**Contents**:
- Architecture overview
- How saving/loading works
- Example scenarios (undocking, resolution changes, etc.)
- Technical details and debugging guide

## Files Modified

### 1. `Core/Services/OverlayPositionPersistenceService.cs` (MODIFIED)
**Changes**:
- Updated `OverlayPositionData` model to include screen information:
  ```csharp
  public string ScreenDeviceName { get; set; }  // e.g., "\\\\.\\DISPLAY2"
  public string ScreenBounds { get; set; }       // e.g., "1920,0,1920,1080"
  ```
- `SavePosition()` now captures and saves screen info via `ScreenPositionManager.GetScreenInfo()`
- `LoadPosition()` validates saved position using `ValidateAndCorrectForDisplayChanges()`
- Added logic to adjust position proportionally when screen bounds change
- Enhanced debug output with screen information

**Key Changes**:
```csharp
// Saving now includes screen info
var screenInfo = ScreenPositionManager.GetScreenInfo(x, y);
var newPosition = new OverlayPositionData
{
    X = x,
    Y = y,
    ScreenDeviceName = screenInfo.DeviceName,  // NEW
    ScreenBounds = screenInfo.Bounds,           // NEW
    // ... other properties
};

// Loading validates and corrects for display changes
bool needsCorrection = ValidateAndCorrectForDisplayChanges(position, out correctedX, out correctedY);
```

### 2. `MainWindow.xaml.cs` (MODIFIED)
**Changes**:
- Updated `SaveOverlayPosition()` to save screen information:
  ```csharp
  var screenInfo = ScreenPositionManager.GetScreenInfo(x, y);
  _settingsManager.AppSettings.OverlayScreenDevice = screenInfo.DeviceName;
  _settingsManager.AppSettings.OverlayScreenBounds = screenInfo.Bounds;
  ```
- Updated `OnOverlayPositionChanged()` to save screen information
- Both methods now capture screen metadata whenever position changes

### 3. `Core/Services/OverlayService.cs` (ALREADY MODIFIED)
**Note**: This file already had references to `ScreenPositionManager` which didn't exist yet:
```csharp
bool positionCorrected = ScreenPositionManager.ValidateAndCorrectPosition(settings, out validatedX, out validatedY);
```
Now this code will work properly with the newly created `ScreenPositionManager`.

### 4. `Classes/AppSettings.cs` (ALREADY HAD PROPERTIES)
**Note**: These properties already existed but weren't being used:
```csharp
public string OverlayScreenDevice { get; set; }
public string OverlayScreenBounds { get; set; }
```
Now they are properly populated and used throughout the system.

## How It Works

### Saving Flow
1. User moves overlay → `FloatingOverlay.Window_MouseLeftButtonUp()`
2. Calls `MainWindow.SaveOverlayPosition(x, y)`
3. Gets screen info via `ScreenPositionManager.GetScreenInfo(x, y)`
4. Saves to both:
   - `AppSettings` (JSON file via `AppSettingsManager`)
   - `OverlayPositionData` (separate JSON file via `OverlayPositionPersistenceService`)

### Loading Flow
1. App starts → `MainWindow.MainWindow_Loaded()`
2. Loads saved position from `OverlayPositionPersistenceService.LoadPosition()`
3. Validates using `ValidateAndCorrectForDisplayChanges()`
4. If screen config changed:
   - Calculates relative position within old screen
   - Applies to new screen (or primary if missing)
5. Updates `AppSettings` and applies to `OverlayService`

## Position Correction Examples

### Example 1: Screen Unplugged (Laptop Undocking)
```
Before: Overlay at (2560, 400) on secondary monitor
After: Secondary unplugged, only laptop screen remains
Result: Proportional position on primary → (640, 400)
```

### Example 2: Resolution Change
```
Before: 1920x1080, overlay at (1600, 400)
After: 2560x1440 (same monitor, higher res)
Result: Proportional adjustment → (2133, 533)
```

### Example 3: Monitor Rearrangement
```
Before: Monitor at (0,0,1920,1080), overlay at (1600, 400)
After: Same monitor now at (1920,0,1920,1080)
Result: Position adjusted → (3520, 400)
```

## Debugging

All functionality includes DEBUG output wrapped in compiler directives:

```csharp
#if DEBUG
    Debug.WriteLine($"[ScreenPositionManager] Position corrected: ({oldX}, {oldY}) -> ({newX}, {newY})");
    Debug.WriteLine(ScreenPositionManager.GetScreenDiagnostics());
#endif
```

This means:
- ✓ Debug output in Debug builds
- ✗ No overhead in Release builds

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Single Monitor**:
   - Position overlay, restart app
   - Verify position restored correctly

2. **Multi-Monitor - No Changes**:
   - Position overlay on secondary monitor
   - Restart app with same monitor setup
   - Verify position restored on correct monitor

3. **Laptop Undocking**:
   - Position overlay on external monitor
   - Unplug external monitor
   - Restart app
   - Verify overlay moved to laptop screen proportionally

4. **Docking**:
   - Position overlay on laptop screen
   - Dock laptop (add external monitors)
   - Restart app
   - Verify overlay moved to appropriate screen

5. **Resolution Change**:
   - Position overlay
   - Change display resolution
   - Restart app
   - Verify position adjusted proportionally

6. **Monitor Rearrangement**:
   - Rearrange monitors in Windows Display Settings
   - Restart app
   - Verify overlay follows its screen

## Key Technical Decisions

### Why DeviceName?
- Persists across reboots
- Unique per physical monitor
- Available via Windows Forms `Screen` API

### Why Save Bounds?
- Detects when screen resolution/position changes
- Enables proportional repositioning
- More reliable than just coordinates

### Why Two Save Locations?
- `appsettings.json` - User-visible settings
- `overlay_position.json` - Specialized persistence with debouncing
- Redundancy ensures position isn't lost

### Why Proportional Repositioning?
- Better user experience than arbitrary placement
- Maintains relative position within screen space
- Handles various display config changes gracefully

## Migration Notes

**Existing Users**:
- Old position files without screen info still work
- System falls back to coordinate validation
- Screen info captured on first position change

**No Breaking Changes**:
- All changes are additive
- Backwards compatible with existing settings
- Graceful degradation if screen info missing

## Performance Considerations

- **Debouncing**: Position saves debounced (300ms) to prevent excessive writes
- **Caching**: Screen info cached during validation
- **Lazy Loading**: Screen diagnostics only generated when needed
- **Async Saves**: File writes use async I/O

## Future Enhancements

1. **EDID Fingerprinting**: Use monitor EDID for more reliable identification
2. **Multi-Profile**: Save different positions for different display configs
3. **Visual Confirmation**: Briefly show overlay on app start
4. **Position Presets**: Quick access to common positions (corners, etc.)
5. **Auto-Hide on Display Change**: Temporarily hide during transitions
